## Caching the Inverse of a Matrix:
## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some 
## benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly.
## Below are a pair of functions that are used to create a special object that 
## stores a matrix and caches its inverse.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.


makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  
  inv <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y #setting value to the object
    inv <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinv <- function(inverse) inv <<- inverse
  getinv <- function() inv
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinv = setinv,
       getinv = getinv)
}


 ## This function finds the inverse of the special "matrix" created by 
## makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated ,
##then it should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
       
  inv <- x$getinv()
  if(!is.null(inv)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(inv)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  inv <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinv(inv)
  inv
}
